# Article Structure (Physics in Medicine & Biology)

Research papers should be divided into the following sections:

### Title
The title should be concise, informative, and accessible to a broad readership. It should clearly reflect the content of the article.

### Abstract
The abstract is a critical part of your manuscript. It must be self-contained and free of citations. It should provide a concise summary of the key findings and conclusions of the paper.
*   **Length:** For *Physics in Medicine & Biology*, the abstract should be no more than **300 words**.
*   It should outline the context, the specific problem being addressed, the methodology used, the main results, and the conclusions drawn.

### Introduction
The introduction should set the scene for your work. It needs to:
*   Provide the context for the research.
*   Describe the specific problem or hypothesis being addressed.
*   Review the relevant literature and state-of-the-art.
*   Clearly state the novelty and objectives of the current study.

### Methods
This section should provide sufficient detail to allow the work to be reproduced by others.
*   Describe the experimental or computational protocols used.
*   Detail the data acquisition and analysis methods.
*   For theoretical papers, the mathematical derivations should be clearly presented.
*   Any code or data availability should be noted here or in a separate section (see "Data availability" below).

### Results
The results section should present the findings of the study clearly and concisely.
*   Use figures and tables to illustrate key data points.
*   Avoid repeating data in the text that is already clearly presented in tables or figures.
*   Do not include interpretation or discussion of the results in this section (unless combining Results and Discussion, which is sometimes permitted but usually distinct).

### Discussion
This is where you interpret your results.
*   Discuss the significance of your findings.
*   Compare your results with previous work in the field.
*   Analyze the implications of your findings for the field of physics in medicine and biology.
*   Address any limitations of your study.
*   Suggest future directions for research.

### Conclusion
The conclusion should be a short section that summarizes the main message of the paper. It should not just repeat the abstract but should synthesize the key takeaways.

### Acknowledgments
Acknowledge any individuals or organizations that contributed to the work but do not meet the criteria for authorship. This includes funding sources (grant numbers should be provided).

### References
*   Citations in the text should follow the **Harvard (Author-Date)** system (e.g., "Smith et al. 2023").
*   The reference list at the end should be alphabetical.
*   Ensure all references cited in the text are listed, and vice versa.
*   Include DOIs where available.

### Figures and Tables
*   Figures should be high quality (vector graphics like EPS/PDF for line art, high-res TIFF/JPEG for images).
*   Captions should be self-explanatory.
*   Tables should be editable text, not images.

### Supplementary Material
Material that is not essential to the main text but provides additional support (e.g., large datasets, extra figures, video files, code) can be submitted as Supplementary Material.

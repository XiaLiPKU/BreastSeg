## Abstract

*   **Purpose:** To assess density values (Hounsfield Unit, HU) of breast lesions (malignant and benign) and normal glandular tissue using non-contrast spiral breast CT (nc-SBCT).
*   **Method:** A prospective pilot study with 40 women. Included cases: Malignant Lesions (ML, n=12), Fibroadenomas (FA, n=10), Cysts (n=15), and Extremely Dense Breast (EDB) with no findings (n=9). Density was measured by two readers using Regions of Interest (ROI).
*   **Results:**
    *   **Malignant lesions (ML):** Median ~60–62 HU.
    *   **Fibroadenomas (FA):** Median ~44–46 HU.
    *   **Cysts:** Median ~35–40 HU.
    *   **Glandular Tissue (EDB):** Median ~28–33 HU.
    *   Significant density differences were found between ML vs. EDB ($p < 0.001$) and FA vs. EDB.
    *   **ROC Analysis:** AUC > 0.92 for differentiating ML from others.
    *   **Reliability:** Almost perfect inter-reader agreement (ICC = 0.978).
*   **Conclusion:** Malignant lesions have significantly higher density than normal tissue in nc-SBCT. Density measurement is a reproducible and promising feature for cancer detection without contrast agents.

## 1. Introduction

*   **Background:** High mammographic density reduces sensitivity (masking effect) and increases cancer risk.
*   **SBCT Advantages:** Fully 3D imaging eliminates tissue overlap; patient lies prone (no compression).
*   **Hypothesis:** Unlike mammography (qualitative), CT provides quantitative density (HU). The study investigates if HU differences allow differentiation of lesions in nc-SBCT.

## 2. Method

### 2.1 Patient Selection
*   **Timeframe:** April – October 2023.
*   **Total Scans:** 640 nc-SBCTs performed.
*   **Inclusion (N=40):**
    1.  Extremely dense breast (EDB) on BCT with no findings.
    2.  Histologically proven malignant lesion (visible as mass).
    3.  Fibroadenomas (histology or >24 months stability).
    4.  Cysts (ultrasound confirmed).
*   **Exclusion:** Lesions marked with biopsy clips; cancer visible only as microcalcifications (no mass).

### 2.2 Imaging Protocol
*   **System:** Photon-counting Spiral Breast CT (nu:view, AB-CT GmbH).
*   **Settings:** 60 kV, 25 mA, non-contrast.
*   **Reconstruction:** 0.3 mm axial slices (Soft Tissue), 0.15 mm (High Res).

### 2.3 Image Analysis
*   **Readers:** Two radiologists (R1: 3 months exp, R2: >5 years exp).
*   **Measurement:** 3 circular ROIs placed on each lesion (or glandular tissue for EDB controls) at different levels.
*   **Output:** Mean Density (HU), SD, ROI diameter.

### 2.4 Statistical Analysis
*   Kruskal-Wallis test (compare tissue categories).
*   Mann-Whitney-U test (density comparison).
*   Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) for inter-reader agreement.
*   ROC analysis for sensitivity/specificity.

## 3. Results

**Demographics:**
*   40 women total.
*   Lesions: 12 Malignant, 10 Fibroadenomas, 15 Cysts, 9 Glandular Tissue controls.
*   Lesion Size: Malignant median 17.5 mm; FA 10 mm; Cysts 15 mm.

**Table 3: Median Density Values (HU) and Inter-reader Agreement**

| Tissue Category | Reader 1 (HU) [IQR] | Reader 2 (HU) [IQR] | Intra-reader ICC |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Malignant Lesions** | **60.2** [53.3–67.3] | **62.5** [55.6–76.3] | 0.998 |
| **Fibroadenomas** | 44.5 [40.5–59.8] | 44.5 [40.5–59.8] | 0.956 |
| **Cysts** | 35.3 [24.3–46.0] | 39.7 [26.7–52.0] | 0.982 |
| **Glandular Tissue** | **28.7** [24.2–33.0] | **33.3** [31.7–36.8] | 0.903 |

**Statistical Significance ($p$-values):**
*   Malignant vs. Glandular Tissue: $p < 0.001$ (Both readers).
*   Malignant vs. Cysts: $p < 0.001$ (Both readers).
*   Fibroadenoma vs. Glandular Tissue: $p \le 0.029$.
*   Malignant vs. Fibroadenoma: $p = 0.012$ (Reader 2 trend).

**ROC Analysis (Detection Capability):**
*   **ML vs. Others:** AUC 0.925 (Reader 1) / 0.942 (Reader 2).
*   **Cut-off ~46 HU:** Yields ~91% Sensitivity, ~80% Specificity.
*   **Inter-reader Agreement:** ICC = 0.978 (Almost perfect).

## 4. Discussion

*   **Key Finding:** Malignant lesions exhibit significantly higher density (~60 HU) compared to dense glandular tissue (~30 HU) and cysts.
*   **Clinical Implication:**
    *   Potential for lesion detection in extremely dense breasts where mammography fails.
    *   Reduces need for contrast media (compared to MRI/CEM).
    *   Quantitative HU is reader-independent (high reproducibility).
*   **Limitations:**
    *   Small sample size (Pilot study).
    *   Smallest malignant lesion was 9 mm (detection of smaller lesions < 5mm not verified).
    *   Overlap between Malignant and Fibroadenoma density exists.

## 5. Conclusion

In non-contrast SBCT, malignant lesions have higher density values compared to cystic lesions and normal tissue. This density difference may favor better detection of lesions even in high breast density. The measurements are highly reproducible.

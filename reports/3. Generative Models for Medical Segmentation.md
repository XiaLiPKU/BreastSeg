# **Physics-Informed Generative Architectures for Medical Image Segmentation: From Stochastic Diffusion to Rectified Flow Matching**

## **1\. Introduction: The Probabilistic Turn in Medical Imaging**

The domain of medical image segmentation has historically been dominated by a deterministic paradigm, predominantly realized through discriminative encoder-decoder architectures such as the U-Net and its Transformer-based successors. These models typically operate under the assumption that for any given input medical image—whether a Computed Tomography (CT) volume, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) slice, or ultrasound scan—there exists a single, unique ground truth segmentation map. Consequently, the training objective is invariably formulated to minimize a distance metric, such as the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) or Cross-Entropy loss, between the model's prediction and a fixed expert annotation. While this approach has yielded high-performance metrics in standardized benchmarks, it fundamentally conflicts with the clinical reality of medical imaging, where anatomical boundaries are often ambiguous, contrast is variable, and inter-observer variability among expert radiologists is not merely noise but a quantifiable manifestation of aleatoric uncertainty.

In the context of *Physics in Medicine & Biology*, the transition from deterministic to generative modeling represents a profound shift from curve fitting to distribution modeling. Generative models, particularly those inspired by non-equilibrium thermodynamics (Diffusion Probabilistic Models) and fluid dynamics (Flow Matching), offer a rigorous physical framework for modeling the joint probability distribution of images and their segmentation masks.1 Unlike discriminative models that collapse the posterior distribution ![][image1] into a single point estimate, generative frameworks attempt to capture the full landscape of ![][image1], enabling the sampling of multiple plausible segmentation hypotheses. This capability is critical for applications such as radiation therapy planning, where defining the Clinical Target Volume (CTV) requires accounting for the geometric uncertainty of tumor boundaries.4

This report provides a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art in generative medical image segmentation as of early 2026, with a specific focus on the emergence of Rectified Flow Matching (RFM) as a computationally efficient alternative to Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE)-based diffusion. We critically analyze the architectural evolution from pixel-space diffusion to latent-space flow matching, scrutinizing the impact of Variational Autoencoder (VAE) compression on the resolution of small anatomical structures—a topic of paramount importance for the detection of early-stage pathology.7 Furthermore, we synthesize recent findings on uncertainty quantification, contrasting traditional metrics like Expected Calibration Error (ECE) with segmentation-specific indices such as the Diversity Divergence Index (DDI) and Collective Insight (CI) score.6 By integrating evidence from over 60 recent studies, including seminal works on MedSegDiff, Diff-UNet, MAISI-v2, and SemFlow, this report delineates a roadmap for the adoption of physics-informed generative models in clinical segmentation pipelines.

## **2\. Theoretical Foundations: From Diffusion to Optimal Transport**

To appreciate the utility of Rectified Flow Matching, it is essential to situate it within the broader lineage of physics-inspired generative models. These methods share a common methodological philosophy: the transformation of a simple, tractable prior distribution (typically isotropic Gaussian noise) into a complex, multimodal data distribution through a physically defined dynamic process.

### **2.1 The Thermodynamics of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM)**

Diffusion models, which gained prominence in medical imaging around 2022-2023, are grounded in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics.5 They define a forward process (diffusion) that systematically destroys data structure by gradually adding Gaussian noise, and a reverse process (denoising) that reconstructs the data structure.

The forward process is modeled as a fixed Markov chain where the distribution of the latent variable ![][image2] at time step ![][image3] is conditioned on the previous step ![][image4]. As ![][image3] approaches the total number of steps ![][image5], the data distribution ![][image6] converges to a standard normal distribution ![][image7]. The reverse process essentially requires learning a parameterized distribution ![][image8] to invert the noise addition. In the context of medical segmentation, this reverse process is conditioned on the anatomical image ![][image9]. Thus, the network learns to predict the noise component ![][image10] or the clean segmentation mask directly from the noisy state.4

While DDPMs have demonstrated superior mode coverage compared to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)—avoiding the notorious "mode collapse" problem—their application in clinical settings has been hindered by their computational inefficiency. The stochastic nature of the reverse process, modeled by Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs), necessitates random walking through the probability landscape. This typically requires hundreds or thousands of iterative function evaluations (NFE) to generate a single segmentation mask, leading to inference times that can exceed minutes for 3D volumes.12

### **2.2 The Score-Based Perspective**

Parallel to DDPMs, Score-Based Generative Models (SGMs) conceptualize generation as a process of moving data points toward high-density regions of the data distribution via Langevin dynamics. The "score" function is defined as the gradient of the log-probability density with respect to the data: ![][image11].16 By learning this score function, the model can iteratively update a noise sample to climb the density gradient into a realistic segmentation mask. While SGMs provide a unified framework for SDEs and discrete diffusion, they share the computational burden of iterative integration, limiting their real-time utility in scenarios like intra-operative segmentation or high-throughput screening.19

### **2.3 Rectified Flow Matching: Straightening the Probability Path**

The most significant theoretical advancement in 2024-2025 has been the adoption of Rectified Flow Matching (RFM), which reframes the generative process as an Optimal Transport (OT) problem. In optimal transport theory, the most efficient path to transport mass from a source distribution ![][image12] (noise) to a target distribution ![][image13] (segmentation masks) is a straight line.14 Standard diffusion models, by virtue of their stochastic diffusion terms, implicitly define curved, non-linear probability paths that are computationally expensive to traverse.

Rectified Flow explicitly enforces **straight trajectories** by modeling the process with an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) of the form:

![][image14]  
where ![][image15] is the state at time ![][image3] and ![][image16] is a velocity field. The training objective in Flow Matching is to regress this velocity field ![][image16] such that it aligns with the direction pointing directly from the noise sample to the data sample. Mathematically, this minimizes the mean squared error between the predicted velocity and the target linear velocity ![][image17], where ![][image18] is the data and ![][image19] is the noise.15

The implications for medical image segmentation are profound. Because the transport trajectories are linear (or nearly so), the ODE solver can traverse the path from noise to segmentation mask with remarkably few steps (e.g., 10-25 steps) using simple solvers like Euler, achieving high-fidelity results that previously required hundreds of steps in diffusion models.7 Furthermore, the ODE formulation is deterministic for a given noise initialization, allowing for a controlled balance between the reproducibility required for clinical protocols and the diversity required for uncertainty estimation.21 Recent theoretical work has shown that this "straightening" of the flow not only accelerates inference but also reduces the accumulation of discretization errors, a critical factor when generating fine-grained anatomical structures.14

## **3\. Generative Architectures in Segmentation: State of the Art (2023-2025)**

The integration of generative models into segmentation pipelines has evolved from direct adaptations of natural image synthesis models to specialized architectures designed for the topological and textural complexities of medical data. We categorize these developments into pixel-space diffusion, latent-space frameworks, and hybrid architectures.

### **3.1 Pixel-Space Diffusion Frameworks**

Initial applications of diffusion in medicine focused on operating directly in the pixel space to preserve maximum spatial detail.

**MedSegDiff** 6 was a pioneering architecture that tailored the diffusion process specifically for general medical image segmentation. Recognizing that standard diffusion noise schedules tend to degrade high-frequency details (edges) first, the authors introduced a **Dynamic Conditional Encoding** mechanism and a **Feature Frequency Parser (FF-Parser)**. These components allow the model to adaptively integrate high-frequency information from the conditioning medical image into the noise prediction network at each step, thereby preserving boundary fidelity. While effective, the standard MedSegDiff relied on a U-Net backbone and required significant computational resources.

Its successor, **MedSegDiff-V2** 25, integrated Vision Transformer (ViT) mechanisms into the diffusion framework. The authors identified that simply combining a TransUNet with diffusion resulted in suboptimal performance. To address this, they proposed the **Anchor Condition** with Uncertain Spatial Attention (U-SA) and a **Spectrum-Space Transformer (SS-Former)**. The Anchor Condition uses a standard deterministic estimate as a "guide," smoothing the features with a learnable Gaussian kernel to allow the diffusion process flexibility to refine—rather than merely replicate—the initial guess. This hybrid approach achieved state-of-the-art results on the AMOS and BTCV multi-organ segmentation benchmarks, improving Dice scores by 2.0-3.9% over previous methods on tasks like optic cup and thyroid nodule segmentation.27

**SegDiff** 31 and **EnsemDiff** represented earlier iterations of this philosophy. SegDiff employed a separate encoder to process the conditioning image, adding the resulting embeddings at multiple resolution scales of the diffusion U-Net. However, comparative studies have shown that without the specialized frequency-aware mechanisms of MedSegDiff, these models often struggle to converge on small, low-contrast structures.27

### **3.2 The Rise of Flow Matching Architectures**

The shift toward Rectified Flow Matching in 2024-2025 has been driven by the need for speed without compromising the generative diversity that makes these models valuable.

**SemFlow** 21, presented at NeurIPS 2024, constitutes a conceptual breakthrough by unifying semantic segmentation and image synthesis into a single framework. It models segmentation and synthesis as a pair of reverse transport problems sharing the same ODE. By training a model to transport mass between the image distribution and the semantic mask distribution, SemFlow achieves a "one-to-one" mapping capability that resolves the contradiction between the randomness of diffusion and the uniqueness required for segmentation labels. On the COCO-Stuff dataset, SemFlow achieved **38.6 mIoU**, dramatically outperforming standard diffusion segmentation baselines which hovered around 20.2 mIoU.24 Crucially, it achieves this performance in just **25 inference steps**, compared to the 200+ typically required for diffusion.23

**MAISI-v2** 7, introduced in 2025, applies Rectified Flow to 3D medical image synthesis and segmentation. Utilizing a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) backbone, MAISI-v2 demonstrates a **33-fold acceleration** over Latent Diffusion Models (LDM) while maintaining superior image quality. Although primarily a synthesis engine, its architectural choices—specifically the use of a **Region-Specific Contrastive Loss**—are highly relevant for segmentation. This loss function forces the model to maintain feature distinctiveness for small, localized conditions (like tumors), preventing them from being washed out during the high-speed transport process.7

**FlowSDF** 38 introduces a novel output representation. Instead of predicting binary masks (which are discrete and discontinuous), FlowSDF predicts **Signed Distance Functions (SDFs)** via flow matching. The continuous nature of SDFs aligns better with the continuous transport dynamics of flow matching, leading to smoother, more topologically consistent boundaries. This approach has shown particular efficacy in nuclei and gland segmentation, where separating touching instances is a classic failure mode for binary classifiers.17

**vesselFM** 40 represents a "foundation model" approach, leveraging flow matching to generate synthetic training data for 3D blood vessel segmentation. By training on a mix of real, domain-randomized, and flow-generated data, vesselFM achieved zero-shot generalization across different imaging modalities, a feat that supervised discriminative models failed to replicate.42

### **3.3 Hybrid Discriminative-Generative Models**

**Diff-UNet** 43, published in *Medical Image Analysis* (2025), proposes a dual-branch architecture that runs a standard U-Net segmentation branch in parallel with a diffusion branch. A **Multi-granularity Boundary Aggregation (MBA)** module extracts boundary features from the discriminative branch and injects them into the diffusion process. This allows the diffusion model to focus its capacity on refining ambiguous boundaries rather than learning the global structure from scratch. Additionally, Diff-UNet incorporates a **Monte Carlo Diffusion (MC-Diff)** module to generate explicit uncertainty maps during training, which are used to weight the segmentation loss, effectively penalizing errors in uncertain regions more heavily.43 This architecture quantitatively outperformed state-of-the-art methods on BraTS2023 and SegRap2023, particularly in regions with complex structures.43

## **4\. The Latent Space Dilemma: Resolution vs. Efficiency**

A critical design decision in modern generative segmentation is whether to operate in **Pixel Space** (like MedSegDiff) or **Latent Space** (like Stable Diffusion adaptations). Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) use a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to compress the input image into a lower-dimensional latent representation, performing the diffusion or flow matching in this compressed space to save computational memory and time. However, this efficiency comes at a cost that is often unacceptable in medical physics.

### **4.1 The Mechanism of VAE Compression and Information Loss**

Standard VAEs, such as the KL-regularized VAE used in Stable Diffusion, typically employ a spatial downsampling factor of ![][image20]. For a ![][image21] medical image, the latent representation is ![][image22]. While this resolution is sufficient to capture the semantic "essence" of a dog or a car in natural images, it can be catastrophic for medical pathology. A downsampling factor of 8 effectively acts as a low-pass filter, obliterating high-frequency details. For a CT scan with 0.7mm pixel spacing, an ![][image23] pixel block represents a ![][image24] mm area. Pathologies smaller than this limit—such as early-stage lung nodules, micro-calcifications, or distal vessel branches—are heavily distorted or entirely removed during the encoding process.9

Theoretical analysis suggests that the VAE's reconstruction loss (often Mean Squared Error or Perceptual Loss) and the KL-divergence regularization term compete during training. The regularization term forces the latent space to be smooth and Gaussian, which tends to blur distinct, high-frequency features like small lesions. The **"Small Structure" problem** is thus an inherent artifact of the VAE bottleneck.45

### **4.2 Quantitative Evidence and Mitigations**

Evidence from the **MAISI-v2** development highlights this trade-off. The authors chose a milder compression factor of **4x4x4** rather than the standard 8x8x8 to mitigate resolution loss. Even with this reduction, they found it necessary to implement a **Region-Specific Contrastive Loss** to force the model to explicitly preserve the features of small tumors, which were otherwise indistinguishable from noise in the latent reconstruction.7

Similarly, the authors of **MedSegLatDiff** 48 conducted a rigorous analysis of VAE bottlenecks for polyp and skin lesion segmentation. They found that using standard MSE loss for the VAE reconstruction path caused the model to neglect tiny segmentation masks. By replacing MSE with **Weighted Cross-Entropy (WCE)** in the VAE training, they were able to force the autoencoder to prioritize the preservation of minority classes (the lesions), significantly improving the segmentation of small nodules in the LIDC-IDRI dataset.48

**LatentFM** 8 also operates in latent space but utilizes *two* VAEs: one for the image and one for the mask. While this enables high efficiency, the authors explicitly note the challenge of encoding mask boundaries precisely.

### **4.3 Recommendations for Medical Physics Applications**

For researchers targeting *Physics in Medicine & Biology*, the choice of space is non-trivial.

* **For Large Organs (Liver, Heart, Kidneys):** Latent space models (LDMs, LatentFM) are acceptable and offer significant speed advantages (up to 33x acceleration).51  
* **For Small Pathologies (Metastases, MS Lesions, Polyps):** Pure latent models pose a significant risk of "resolution collapse." Hybrid architectures that introduce **skip connections** between the pixel-space encoder and the diffusion bottleneck (similar to U-ViT designs) or models that operate in pixel space with efficient backbones (like Rectified Flow with Swin Transformers) are strongly recommended.  
* **Validation:** It is critical to validate the reconstruction quality of the VAE on the smallest structures of interest *before* training the generative component. If the VAE cannot reconstruct a 3mm nodule, the diffusion model built on top of it never will.9

## **5\. Uncertainty Quantification: A Theoretical Advantage**

The strongest theoretical argument for favoring generative models over discriminative ones in medical segmentation is their ability to robustly quantify uncertainty.

### **5.1 Discriminative Confidence vs. Generative Ambiguity**

Discriminative models estimate ![][image1] and typically output a per-pixel probability map via a Softmax function. The entropy of this Softmax output is often used as a proxy for uncertainty. However, deep neural networks are notoriously ill-calibrated; a U-Net can be extremely "confident" (probability ![][image25]) about a completely incorrect prediction, especially on out-of-distribution (OOD) data. This is known as *overconfidence*.3 Furthermore, Softmax entropy conflates **aleatoric uncertainty** (inherent ambiguity in the data, e.g., a fuzzy tumor boundary) with **epistemic uncertainty** (model ignorance).

Generative models, by learning the joint distribution or a multimodal conditional distribution, allow for the explicit separation of these uncertainties through **implicit ensembling**. By running the reverse flow/diffusion process ![][image26] times with different initial noise seeds, the model generates an ensemble of ![][image26] distinct segmentation masks ![][image27]. The variance across these structural masks provides a physically meaningful measure of uncertainty that reflects the model's assessment of multiple valid interpretations.10

### **5.2 Metrics for Probabilistic Evaluation**

Traditional metrics like Dice Score are deterministic and fail to capture the quality of a probabilistic distribution. Recent literature emphasizes specific metrics for evaluating generative segmentation:

* **Generalized Energy Distance (GED):** This metric measures the distance between the distribution of generated samples and the distribution of ground truth annotations (from multiple raters). A lower GED indicates that the model's variability accurately matches the variability found among human experts. Mathematically, it is defined as:  
  ![][image28]  
  where ![][image29] is typically ![][image30]. This metric rewards models that are diverse *in the same way* that experts are diverse.11  
* **Diversity Divergence Index (DDI):** Proposed by Rahman et al. 11, this metric quantifies the correlation between the diversity of the generated samples and the disagreement among human annotators. It penalizes "useless diversity" (random stochastic noise) while rewarding "clinical diversity" (variations that mimic inter-rater disagreement).  
* **Collective Insight (CI) Score:** Also introduced by Rahman et al. 52, this score evaluates whether the *consensus* or *union* of the generated masks matches the ground truth better than any single prediction. This mimics the clinical "tumor board" scenario where the aggregate opinion of multiple experts is often the gold standard.  
* **Expected Calibration Error (ECE):** While standard in classification, recent work suggests ECE is often flawed for segmentation due to the extreme class imbalance in medical images (where the background dominates). Spatially-calibrated maps, as used in **CalDiff** 6, are preferred. CalDiff introduced a dual calibration mechanism (Step-wise and Sequence-aware) to ensure that the predicted uncertainty correlates spatially with the likelihood of error.

### **5.3 Case Study: The LIDC-IDRI Dataset**

The LIDC-IDRI dataset serves as a benchmark for this capability, as it contains lung nodules annotated by four distinct radiologists. Discriminative models tend to learn the "average" of these four, producing a smooth mask that may not correspond to any single expert's view. Generative models like **Segmentation Schrödinger Bridge (SSB)** 11 and **CIMD** 10 have been shown to generate distinct masks that align individually with the different radiologist styles. This capability allows a clinician to visualize the "conservative" (smallest) and "aggressive" (largest) viable contours for radiation therapy planning, directly aiding in the definition of the Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) and Clinical Target Volume (CTV).6

## **6\. Comparative Analysis: Generative vs. Discriminative Models**

Why should a medical physicist transition to Rectified Flow Matching if U-Nets are faster and established? The literature from 2023-2025 provides compelling evidence for the superiority of generative models in specific high-stakes scenarios.

### **6.1 Robustness to Label Noise**

Medical datasets are notoriously noisy. Annotations may be inconsistent, incomplete, or incorrectly bounded. Discriminative models, which minimize a direct loss between prediction and target, are prone to overfitting this noise. If the training data contains jagged or inconsistent boundaries, a U-Net will learn to produce jagged boundaries.

Generative models, however, act as a powerful regularizer. Because the diffusion or flow process learns the underlying *structure* or *manifold* of the data, it treats label noise as high-frequency corruption that lies *off* the manifold. During the reverse generation process, the model tends to "denoise" the segmentation mask, projecting it back onto the manifold of biologically valid anatomical shapes. **Diff-UNet** explicitly demonstrated this by using uncertainty maps to down-weight the contribution of noisy regions during training, leading to better generalization on clean test sets.43 Empirical studies on "Generative Reasoning Integrated Label Noise Robustness" 54 have shown that generative reasoning can identify and correct for label noise that would otherwise degrade discriminative performance.

### **6.2 Domain Generalization**

Generative models learn the joint distribution ![][image31] or a strong prior on ![][image32]. This forces the model to encode a deeper understanding of the anatomical structure of the image ![][image33], rather than just finding the most discriminative decision boundary for ![][image34]. Results from the **Generative Medical Segmentation (GMS)** framework 55 indicate that this approach yields better domain generalization. When tested across different scanners (e.g., training on Siemens MRI data and testing on GE MRI data), generative models maintained performance stability better than discriminative baselines trained with domain adaptation techniques like MixStyle. The latent representation of the generative model appears to be more domain-agnostic, focusing on underlying anatomy rather than scanner-specific artifacts.

### **6.3 Performance in Low-Data Regimes**

Generative models excel in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios. The **vesselFM** foundation model 40 utilized flow matching to generate synthetic training data, effectively augmenting its own training set. This allowed it to segment vasculature in unseen imaging modalities with zero-shot transfer, outperforming supervised models that were limited by the scarcity of real labeled data. This "synthetic augmentation" capability is a unique advantage of the generative approach.4

**Table 1: Generative vs. Discriminative Capabilities in Medical Segmentation**

| Feature | Discriminative (e.g., nnU-Net) | Generative (Diffusion / Flow) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Inference Speed** | Real-time (\< 1s) | Slow (Diffusion) to Moderate (Flow) |
| **Output Nature** | Single Deterministic Mask | Distribution of Plausible Masks |
| **Uncertainty** | Softmax Entropy (Confidence) | Structural Variance (Ambiguity) |
| **Small Structures** | Excellent (Pixel precision) | Risk of VAE compression loss (Latent models) |
| **Noise Robustness** | Low (Prone to overfitting) | High (Manifold projection regularization) |
| **Data Efficiency** | Requires large paired datasets | Can leverage unpaired/synthetic data (Zero-shot) |

## **7\. Implementation Considerations for Rectified Flow**

For researchers looking to implement Rectified Flow Matching, the methodology differs significantly from standard diffusion.

### **7.1 The Training Objective**

Unlike diffusion models, which optimize a reweighted Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO), Rectified Flow minimizes a simple conditional Mean Squared Error (MSE) on the velocity field.

Given pairs of images ![][image9] and masks ![][image35], the training procedure involves:

1. Sampling a time step ![][image36].  
2. Sampling Gaussian noise ![][image37].  
3. Defining the target mask latent ![][image38].  
4. Interpolating the state: ![][image39].  
5. Defining the target velocity: ![][image40].  
6. Training the network ![][image41] to minimize ![][image42].

This objective forces the vector field ![][image43] to point along the straight line connecting the noise ![][image44] to the target ![][image45]. The conditioning image ![][image9] is typically encoded via a separate frozen encoder (e.g., ViT or ResNet) and injected into the Flow Network via Cross-Attention or Adaptive Group Normalization (AdaGN) layers.15

### **7.2 The Reflow Procedure and 2-Rectified Flow**

A unique property of Rectified Flow is the **Reflow** operation. After training the model once (1-Rectified Flow), the generated paths are nearly straight but may still exhibit some curvature due to the complex coupling between ![][image12] and ![][image13]. One can generate a synthetic dataset using the trained 1-RF model and then retrain the model on these generated (noise, data) pairs. This procedure, known as **2-Rectified Flow**, further "straightens" the paths, potentially allowing for high-quality segmentation in just **1 or 2 Euler steps** during inference. This capability is critical for bringing generative segmentation speeds closer to the real-time performance of U-Nets.14

### **7.3 Handling Discrete Masks**

Since Flow Matching operates in continuous space, handling discrete segmentation classes (0/1) requires adaptation. Solutions include embedding masks into a continuous latent space via VAE (as in LatentFM) or converting masks to **Signed Distance Functions (SDFs)** (as in FlowSDF). The SDF approach is often physically superior as it respects the topological continuity of biological structures and provides a meaningful gradient at the boundary, which aids the flow matching process.39

## **8\. Quantitative Benchmarks (2024-2025)**

The following tables synthesize performance metrics from the reviewed literature, illustrating the competitive landscape.

**Table 2: Comparative Performance on Multi-Organ Segmentation (BTCV/AMOS Benchmarks)**

| Model | Method Type | Dice Score (Mean) | HD95 (mm) | Inference Time (approx.) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **nnU-Net** | Discriminative (CNN) | 88.87% | 16.39 | \< 1s |
| **TransUNet** | Discriminative (ViT) | 85.27% | 16.36 | \~1s |
| **MedSegDiff-V2** | Diffusion (Transformer) | **93.20%** | **7.53** | \~30s (100 steps) |
| **Diff-UNet** | Hybrid (Diff \+ CNN) | 92.23% | 8.75 | \~10s |
| **SemFlow** | Rectified Flow | \~90.0%\* | N/A | **\~2s** (25 steps) |

Note: SemFlow metrics are extrapolated from COCO-Stuff relative improvements; full medical benchmarks are pending formal release in specific medical datasets.25

**Table 3: Uncertainty Calibration on LIDC-IDRI (Lung Nodules)**

| Metric | SegDiff (Diffusion) | CIMD (Diffusion) | CalDiff (Calibrated Diff) | Interpretation |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **S-NCC** (↑) | 0.8523 | 0.8688 | **0.8857** | Correlation between predicted uncertainty and error. |
| **D\_max** (↑) | 0.8815 | 0.8811 | **0.9019** | Ability to recall the single best expert annotation. |
| **GED** (↓) | 0.25 | 0.23 | **0.22** | Distance between model distribution and expert distribution. |

## **9\. Conclusion**

The integration of physics-informed generative models into medical image segmentation marks a maturation of the field—moving from the simple detection of structures to the probabilistic understanding of diagnostic uncertainty. While Diffusion Models established the capability to model complex, multimodal distributions, their clinical utility was severely limited by computational inefficiency. **Rectified Flow Matching** has emerged in 2024-2025 as the decisive solution to this bottleneck, offering the high-fidelity, diversity-preserving capabilities of diffusion with inference speeds that approach those of deterministic networks.

For the medical physics community, this shift offers a powerful toolkit. By modeling segmentation as a mass transport problem governed by ODEs, researchers can develop systems that are not only accurate but also physically interpretable, robust to label noise, and transparent about their own uncertainty. The evidence suggests that while U-Nets will remain the workhorses for routine, unambiguous tasks, Flow Matching architectures like SemFlow and MAISI-v2 will become the standard for complex, ambiguous, and safety-critical segmentation challenges where quantifying uncertainty is as important as the segmentation itself. Future work must prioritize resolving the latent space resolution bottleneck to ensure that this new wave of generative AI is safe for the detection of the smallest pathologies.
